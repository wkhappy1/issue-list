1.problem
    I have a project A that depends on the B jar package. 
    Then we need to upgrade gralde to 7.4. 
    And project B repackaged and upload to our nexus via publishing.
    project A use one of project B's dependcies.
    after upgrade gradle,project A can't compile.

    solution
    After opening B's pom.xml,I found out that the dependency in B scope is runtime,so A compiled failed.
    what i need to do is change dependency scope to compile.so i changed B's dependency to api scope, then reupload.problem fixed
